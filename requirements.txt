audiomentations>=0.39.0 # Align with MicroWakeWord-Trainer-Docker
piper-phonemize==1.1.0 # Specific to Piper, assume compatible
numpy>=1.21 # Allow newer numpy, compatible with recent PyTorch
# torch>=2.1, <2.4 # Example: Aim for a recent, stable PyTorch 2.x
# torchaudio>=2.1, <2.4 # Align with torch version
# The specific torch and torchaudio versions should be chosen carefully
# based on the CUDA version in the tensorflow:2.19.0-gpu-jupyter base image.
# For now, leaving them commented out, as they are often best installed
# with specific CUDA versions in mind (e.g., using pip's index URLs for PyTorch).
# The Dockerfile for MicroWakeWord-Trainer-Docker will handle PyTorch installation
# if it's not in the base image, ensuring CUDA compatibility.
# If this piper-sample-generator is used standalone, user needs to install a compatible PyTorch.
